  - Visual Studio 2005 is now the supported Windows environment.  The projects 
    and some of the solutions have been updated.  We will not be maintaining
    older Visual Studio 2003 project files.
  - This is the initial pass at VS2005 conformance.  It will build and run
    properly, but there are still a lot of warnings to clean up.

a6.2-:

  - Netstream fix. Streams ending in .ogg and .mp3 are now handled
    correctly.
  - New musikCore::BatchChgCase and musikCore::BatchChgCaseThread
    to do batch case changes on tags.
  - FMOD upgraded to 3.72. Optionally, FMOD 3.71 can also be used,
    check the #define in musikConfig.h
  - musikCore::TaskQueue added and implemented in musikCore::Library.
    This should take away any problems or issues interfaces may have 
    with queuing their own threads. Any number of instances of this
    object may exist for any purpose, and will act independantly of
    one another.
  - musik:: namespace renamed musikCore::
  - netstreams are no longer purged on synchronization.
