# musikcube-legacy
this is a mirror of the original musikcube win32 app, circa 2004-2007. it is no longer maintained. this was the first "real" project i ever worked on -- it was started when i was a sophomore in college, and finished the year i graduated. as such, the code is... not great. it does, however, work surprisingly well!

a new version, written from the ground up, may be found [here](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube).
