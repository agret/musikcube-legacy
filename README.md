# musikcube-legacy
this is a mirror of the original musikcube win32 app, circa 2004-2007. it is no longer maintained. this was the first "real" project i ever worked on -- it was started when i was a sophomore in college, and finished the year i graduated. as such, the code is... not great. it does, however, work surprisingly well!

although this code is not actively maintained, the visual studio 2005 solution and projects were migrated to visual studio 2017 community edition! that means it compiles and runs again using freely available tools.

a new version, written from the ground up, can be found [here](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube).
